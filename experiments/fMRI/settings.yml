    Here I need to tell you some brutal truth:
    In this experiment, there are four locations where 'gabors' appear. 
    What you might not know is that the targets and distractors are not 
    equally distributed! One of these locations is a High Probability 
    Location (HPL) for distractors, making it more likely to contain 
    a distractor than the others.
    
    Now, in the following quiz, some locations may be highlighted. If 
    you believe the HPL is more likely among the highlighted locations, 
    press the LEFT (index finger) button. Otherwise, press the RIGHT 
    (middle finger) button.

    Press any button to start the quiz...

  awareness_text_paired: |
    Do the highlighted locations contain the HPL of distractor?

    Press LEFT for YES, and RIGHT for NO.
  awareness_text_single: |
    Is the highlighted location the HPL for distractors?

    Press LEFT for YES, and RIGHT for NO.
  awareness_rate_instruction_text: |
    In the upcoming quiz, you'll rate how likely that the highlighted 
    location is the HPL for distractors on a scale of 1 to 5.

    Press the LEFT to increase your rating, and press the RIGHT twice 
    to confirm. If your rating exceeds 5, it will be reset to 0.
    
    Press any button to begin the quiz.
  awareness_text_rate: |
    On a scale of 1 to 5, how likely that the highlighted location is the HPL for distractors?
    1 indicates impossible, while 5 signifies very possible. 0 means not rated.
    If you rates exceeds 5, the rating score will be reset to 0.
  awareness_text_rate_operation: |
    Press LEFT to increase your score of rating, and press RIGHT to confirm.
  awareness_text_rate_need_operation: |
    Score cannot be 0! Press LEFT to increase your rating, and press RIGHT to confirm.
  awareness_text_rate_confirm: |
    Press RIGHT again to confirm your choice and continue to 
    the next trial. Press LEFT to cancel this confirmation.
  awareness_text_rate_reset: |
    The rating for this trial has been reset! Press LEFT to increse 
    your score of rating, and then press RIGHT to confirm.
